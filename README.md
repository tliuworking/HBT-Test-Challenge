# HBT-Test-Challenge
This is the test challenge from HBT

The requirement is to implement the following 3 column layout and upload your html css to github. 

1. Three columns should be evenly spaced, the left block should remain to the left (no left margin), the right one should stick to the right (no right margin).
2. Please use the no_img.png that is attached to this email
3. Don't worry about the font, but heading and body color should match the provided image. 
4. Use <a class="button"></a> as the button and we would like to see your style set up in the corresponding CSS section. 
5. You can utilize bootstrap columns but pure css is also great. 
6. It would also be great if you could build it with task builders eg: gulp/grunt/webpack + scss/less
